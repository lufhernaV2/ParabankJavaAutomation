# ParabankJavaAutomation
This is a small project to showcase Selenium, Java, and Maven work together to automate day to day processes in a dummy bank application. The project is organized using the POM (page object model) design pattern.

When you access a bank account online, what do you need to do? This automation project covers:
- The creation of an online bank account
- Logging in with credentials
- Applying for a loan
- Paying a bill

# ParabankJavaAutomation
This is a small project to showcase Selenium, Java, and Maven work together to automate day to day processes in a dummy bank application. The project is organized using the POM (page object model) design pattern.

When you access a bank account online, what do you need to do? This automation project covers:
- The creation of an online bank account
- Logging in with credentials
- Applying for a loan
- Paying a bill

If you check out the Objects (src/test/java) package you'll see how the files are divided by different user processes. And within the Test Scenario they all come together to test the flows
